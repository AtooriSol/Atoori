- Edge: Double clicking in display area appears to cause text selection (may be resolved)
- Sometimes must disconnect/reconnect gamepad to be recognized
- Hide the identifiers for the components (the names are too obvious and could be reused)
- Gamepads on iOS appears to have different control mappings (need to also test Android)
- Evaluate browser specific dependencies (key input, drag, etc.). Should these be external?
- Add options to support lower performance devices (frame skipping, disable vsync, disable sound)
- Move switches out of KB (should be input?)
- Fix zip load issues (AtariAge game... maybe dungeon stalker?, search for .a78 first)
- Fix top of command bar (not curved, need to fix 10px spacer above command bar)
- Fix select/reset buttons on mobile (does not stay down while pressed, 
  same issue w/ lightgun, need to use touch events)
- Local file selection button is not tabbable (it seems there is now a way to make this 
  work, and does not require javascript, need to investigate)
- Ignore text/html (drag local links into github based js7800)
- Fix bug where you can select the file chooser and cloud download, and drag the file chooser 
  (may be fixed)
- Remove certain images from pack (controller.png, etc.)
- Fix drag of logo image
- Point to my own hosted video (versus the 7800 commercial)
