# JS7800

Ported by raz0red

JS7800 is an enhanced JavaScript port of the ProSystem Atari 7800 emulator developed by Greg Stanton packaged as a JavaScript module.
Portions of the Pokey code were adapted from the MAME implementation.

An example usage of the JS7800 module can be found at the following location:

## JavaScript Module

This particular repository contains the JS7800 JavaScript Module. A JavaScript Module is a self-contained reusable component. The JS7800 module itself is distributed as a single JavaScript file that contains of all the required JavaScript code, CSS, and images required for the emulator to execute. 

Packaging the emulator as a JavaScript module allows the component to be easily utilized for different devices and form factors (web, mobile, tablet, etc.). Currently, a separate repository is being developed that will embed the module and provide many additional features such as settings dialogs, persistence between session, and the ability to save and restore the save states. This README will be updated to reflect the various other related repositories once they become available.
