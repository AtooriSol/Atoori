- Edge: Double clicking in display area appears to cause text selection (may be resolved)
- Sometimes must disconnect/reconnect gamepad to be recognized
- Hide the identifiers for the components (the names are too obvious and could be reused)
- Gamepads on iOS appears to have different control mappings (need to also test Android)
- Evaluate browser specific dependencies (key input, drag, etc.). Should these be external?
- Add options to support lower performance devices (frame skipping, disable vsync, disable sound)
- Move switches out of KB (should be input?)
- Fix zip load issues (AtariAge game... maybe dungeon stalker?, search for .a78 first)
- Fix top of command bar (not curved, need to fix 10px spacer above command bar)
- Fix select/reset buttons on mobile (does not stay down while pressed, 
  same issue w/ lightgun, need to use touch events)
- Local file selection button is not tabbable (it seems there is now a way to make this 
  work, and does not require javascript, need to investigate)
- Ignore text/html (drag local links into github based js7800)
- Fix bug where you can select the file chooser and cloud download, and drag the file chooser 
  (may be fixed)
- Remove certain images from pack (controller.png, etc.)
- Fix drag of logo image
- Create new video with pause at beginning, add other content to it, splice multiple commercials
- Reset ROM select lists when an external rom is loaded (drag, or load, etc.)
- Add documentation to intro screen (settings and info buttons w/ direct links)
- Use init in js7800 to pass common properties around (similar to REGION_NTSC, but for duplicated values).
  Using init eliminates issues with circular dependencies (values were copied previously before init existed)
- Better exception handling (for example, loading global hs, and content is bad, site is down on save and load)
- Check all XHR calls and handle exceptions appropriately
- Fix "Loading..." message. disappears before loading global scores
- Fix snack bar in general. If subsequent messages come in, don't hide, etc. maybe pass token to control
  hiding. If token doesn't match latest, ignore
- Snack bar should allow for specifying timeout
- Add message when global high scores are not supported for a game
- Instead of relying on callback, etc. for messages, use the event system
  Fire events prior to starting load, after load has completed, etc. 
- Add support for games that have multiple codes per game (HSC)
- Add support for 7800 basic score encoding/decoding
