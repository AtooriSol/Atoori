# JS7800

Ported by raz0red

JS7800 is an enhanced JavaScript port of the ProSystem Atari 7800 emulator that was originally developed by Greg Stanton.

In order to operate correctly and smoothly (no lags, etc.), JS7800 requires an updated version of a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) on a capably configured system.
