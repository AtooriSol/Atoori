- Determine approach for fade/show effects (Animate.CSS, CSS directly?)
- Edge: Double clicking in display area appears to cause text selection (may be resolved)
- Better checks for start/stop emulations so 2 can't get started at once
- Sometimes must disconnect/reconnect gamepad to be recognized
- Hide the identifiers for the components (the names are too obvious and could be reused)
- Gamepads on iOS appears to have different control mappings (need to also test Android)
