# JS7800

Ported by raz0red

JS7800 is an enhanced JavaScript port of the ProSystem Atari 7800 emulator that was originally developed by Greg Stanton.

https://raz0red.github.io/js7800

In order to operate correctly and smoothly (no lags, etc.), JS7800 requires an updated version of a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) on a capably configured system.
